# SVHack_simulatemosaic

The goal of this project is to simulate mosaic SNV and SV to evaluate existing tools. For this purpose we are implementing two simulation workflows. Mosaic variant are in generally defined as mutaitons that occure only in a tiny fraction of your reads. This can be for example in 5% of your reads which is also represented as 5% variant allele frequency (VAF).

## 1. Spike in experiments
Here we generate a workflow that can automatically spike in one sample at a given concentration (e.g. 5% VAF) into another sample. 



## 2. Modification experiments
Here we are modifiying reads directly at their reference position to include artifical mutatioins.
